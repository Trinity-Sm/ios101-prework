## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Instagram
    - Messaging
    - Uploading/Seeing posts and videos
- YouTube
    - Creating playlists
    - Videos
- Google Maps
    - Navigation/Directions
    - Real-time updates
    - Shows time it takes to get somewhere
    
    
An app that I would like to build would be a time-management, assignment tracker app. I would want it to have a good bit of customization, a calendar and task list features that includes detailed information about the task/tasks for that day, and I would like it to have reminders/notifications that can pop up outside of the app. I also would want it to have easy moving around, if one tasks moves later the other ones move as well so you dont have to individually go through every task.
